  I'm looking for a change in my professional field. I want to work with something that has more to do with me. Programming has been a challenging and thought-provoking discovery. I always liked the administrative area, but it doesn't challenge me as it had done once.

  After researching for over a year, also listening to close friends, I saw that the Web Development area is a great starting point for this change. I can say that I amo falling in love with "code".

  I am eager to acquire new experiences, contribute to a focused team and be in an area that provides a better quality of life for me and my family.

  <h2 align="center"> A little more about me:</h2>
  <img height="115em" align="left" src="https://github.com/huannvictor/huannvictor/blob/main/assets/business-3d-318.png" alt="businessInLove">

  I'm a guy who likes to work listening to music, drinking coffee and preferably with direct sunlight (a luxury I enjoy nowadays).
  I'm a geek, I try to be fitness, but I love pasta and sweets (and they love me too üòÅ).
  I like to work both with people or remotely (as long as I'll always have someone for happy hour even if it's on the webcam üòú).

  I would love to make new connections within this area to exchange experiences and maybe work opportunities.
